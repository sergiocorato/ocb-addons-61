 I create a picking to stock.location_convenience_shop, which is chained with stock.location_refrigerator
-
  !record {model: stock.picking, id: shipment_with_delivery}:
    type: internal
    carrier_id: delivery.delivery_carrier
    volume: 42
    carrier_tracking_ref: FDX123
    number_of_packages: 7
-
  I add a move in the picking
-
  !record {model: stock.move, id: icecream_move}:
    picking_id: shipment_with_delivery
    product_id: stock.product_icecream
    product_uom: product.product_uom_kgm
    product_qty: 130.0
    location_id: stock.stock_location_suppliers
    location_dest_id: stock.location_convenience_shop
-
 I confirm the picking
-
   !workflow {model: stock.picking, action: button_confirm, ref: shipment_with_delivery}
-
 I check that the delivery fields have been propagated to the chained picking
-
  !python {model: stock.move}: |
     original_move = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('icecream_move'), context=context)
     original_picking = original_move.picking_id
     chained_move = original_move.move_dest_id
     chained_picking = chained_move.picking_id
     assert chained_picking.carrier_tracking_ref == original_picking.carrier_tracking_ref, 'no propagation of carrier_tracking_ref'
     assert chained_picking.carrier_id == original_picking.carrier_id, 'no propagation of carrier_id'
     assert chained_picking.volume == original_picking.volume, 'no propagation of volume'
     assert chained_picking.weight == original_picking.weight, 'no propagation of weight'
     assert chained_picking.weight_net == original_picking.weight_net, 'no propagation of weight'
